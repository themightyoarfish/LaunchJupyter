## LaunchJupyter

Launch jupyter notebooks by double click!

### Steps
   0. Have `jupyter-notebook` available on system and in `PATH`.
   1. Place `LaunchJupyter.app` somewhere.
   2. Set `LaunchJupyter` as default App for `.ipynb` files

### Issues
The Launch script won't terminate when you close the notebook and the server will keep running. You must manually terminate the launcher in the menu bar (look for the spinning wheel)
